Here we will create selenium notes...
1) Differenece between quit() and close()
	quit() is used to completely shut down the WebDriver and close all windows, while close() is used 
	to close the current window and leave other windows open.
	quit(): This method is used to close all browser windows that were opened by the driver. 
	When you call the quit() method, it will close all windows and also kill the WebDriver process. 
	This means that you cannot use the driver anymore after calling the quit() method.

	close(): This method is used to close the current window that the driver is controlling. 
	If there are multiple windows open, calling the close() method will only close the current window and leave the other windows open. 
	You can still use the driver to control the remaining windows after calling the close() method.

	2) What is Action Class?
	Action class is useful mainly for mouse and keyboard actions
	Actions class is an ability provided by Selenium for handling keyboard and mouse events. 
	In Selenium WebDriver, handling these 
	events includes operations such as drag and drop in Selenium, clicking on multiple elements
	 with the control key, among others.
	 
	 Actions action = new Actions(driver);
     action.moveToElement(element).click().perform();
      Mouse Actions in Selenium:

	doubleClick(): Performs double click on the element
	clickAndHold(): Performs long click on the mouse without releasing it
	dragAndDrop(): Drags the element from one point and drops to another
	moveToElement(): Shifts the mouse pointer to the center of the element
	contextClick(): Performs right-click on the mouse
	Keyboard Actions in Selenium:

sendKeys(): Sends a series of keys to the element
keyUp(): Performs key release
keyDown(): Performs keypress without release
