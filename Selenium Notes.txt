Here we will create selenium notes...
1) Differenece between quit() and close()
	quit() is used to completely shut down the WebDriver and close all windows, while close() is used 
	to close the current window and leave other windows open.
	quit(): This method is used to close all browser windows that were opened by the driver. 
	When you call the quit() method, it will close all windows and also kill the WebDriver process. 
	This means that you cannot use the driver anymore after calling the quit() method.

	close(): This method is used to close the current window that the driver is controlling. 
	If there are multiple windows open, calling the close() method will only close the current window and leave the other windows open. 
	You can still use the driver to control the remaining windows after calling the close() method.
